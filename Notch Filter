aka Band-Stop Filter.

This type of filter will attenuate frequencies at a specific point, called the centre frequency, while passing other frequencies.

The Q value defines the width of the filter.

A parallel notch filter will cause an impedance rise in an analogue circuit, a series notch filter will cause an impedance drop.

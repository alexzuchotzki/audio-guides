Crossovers come in two types, analogue and digital.

Analogue crossovers consist of resistors, inductors, and capacitors, forming filters which tailor the frequency response of an electrical system.

Digital crossovers are based on transfer functions, allowing them to mimic analogue designs, or surpass them when complex behaviour is required.

Primary use: Blending multiple drivers together to achieve broad frequency coverage in a speaker system.

Example: High-pass for a tweeter, low-pass for a woofer, resistors to level match the tweeter to the woofer. Notch filter to remove frequency response peak.
